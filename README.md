A Java-based banking app's REST API, following RESTful principles and MVC architecture, utilizes Spring Boot for rapid development. 
It employs JPA for database interaction with annotated entities like User, Account, and Transaction. Security features, 
including Spring Security, protect sensitive data. Endpoints like POST /api/users and GET /api/accounts/{accountId} provide user and account functionalities. 
DTO validation ensures data integrity, while exception handling, logging, and testing enhance reliability.
API documentation using Swagger or Spring RestDocs clarifies usage. 
Considerations for scalability, deployment, monitoring, and logging round out the robust implementation,
emphasizing security and best practices in financial data handling.
